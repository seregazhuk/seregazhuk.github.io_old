Today I have decided to test my skills in translation from English to Russian. When reading a book or
an article on a foreign language mentally you tranlsate it in your native language. My choice fell on 
<a target="_blank" href="http://code.tutsplus.com">EnvatoTuts+ code tutorials</a>. They provide a service
called <a target="_blank" href="https://getnative.me">Native</a> for translating their
articles on a variety of different languages. It is a voluntary project, so I will not gain any money for
my translations. But it's like open-source projects, you don't contribute for money, you do it for 
something else.

As for me I translate for several reasons:

- Practice in a foreign language. Improve my skills in English.
- It's some kind of learing. When you translate an article, you read it very attentively, even several times.
- Help other people to read articles they want.

After three days I've already translated all articles in the series of desing patterns and several 
articels about Laravel. Here is my <a target="_blank" href="https://getnative.me/user/5521">Native profile<a/>.
