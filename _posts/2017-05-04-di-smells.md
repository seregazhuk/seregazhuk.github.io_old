In the [previous article]({% post_url 2017-04-25-di-constructor-vs-setter %}), I have discussed the difference between constructor and setter injections. Now, it's time to pay attention to some examples of *how not to use* Dependency Injection.

## Too many dependencies

When a class has a lot of dependencies, often in a constructor it is the first sign that this has does too much and has a lot of responsibilities (violates Single Responsibility Principle):

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class OrderController
{
    public function __construct(
            OrdersRepository $ordersRepo, 
            PaymentGateway $payments, 
            ShippingService $shipping,
            Logger $logger
            Email $mailer
            )
    {
        $this->ordersRepo = $ordersRepo;
        $this->paymentGateway = $payments;
        $this->shipping = $shipping;
        $this->logger = $logger;
        $this->mail = $mailer;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

At first, examine your constructor dependencies, maybe some of them are not required to be in a constructor and can be passed via method injection. For example, it is unlikely that we will need an instance of `ShippingService` to process payment. But this approach does not really solve the problem. 

Another option will be to pass only a container to the constructor and later resolve all of these dependencies.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class OrderController
{
    public function __construct(Container $container)
    {
        $this->ordersRepo = $container->get('ordersRepository');
        $this->paymentGateway = $container->get('paymentGateway');
        $this->shipping = $container->get('PaymentGateway');
        $this->logger = $container->get('Logger');
        $this->mail = $container->get('Email');
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

But, in this context, it will be an anti-pattern Service Locator. Depending on a container hides all the information about class dependencies. If we want to test this class, we should examine the class and find out all the dependencies that it resolves out of the container and mock them for every test. We also cannot be sure that all the dependencies are already correctly registered in the container. In this way, we lose all advantages of Dependency Injection. Objects shouldn't know about the container.

A better option is to break `OrderController` into several small classes, each with its own responsibility, like `PaymentController` or `ShippingController`.

## Cyclic Dependencies

Class `A` depends on class `B`, but class `B` depends on `A`.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class A {
    protected $b;

    public function __construct(B $b) {
        $this->b = $b;
    }
}

class B {
    public $a;

    protected function setA(A $a) {
        $this->a = $a;
    }
{% endhighlight %}

This sort of dependency often means that you don't really have two independent classes. Chances high, that these classes share one common responsibility, so maybe they both should be one class, rather than two separate.


## Injecting Dependencies For Other Objects

An object receives a dependency that it doesn't actually use, instead it simply passes this dependency to another object.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class DeliveryController 
{
    protected $http;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $http)
    {
        $this->http = $http;
    }

    public function sendOrder($orderId)
    {
        $order = Order::find($orderId);

        (new Delivery($this->http))->sendOrder($order);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

`DeliveryController` depends on `HttpClient` and doesn't actually use it. The only reason to depend on `HttpClient` is to pass it later build an instance of `Delivery` class. The problem here is that we are coupled to `Delivery` class. It is hardcoded here with the `new` keyword. But even if we are not going to use another class here, we are still coupled to `Delivery` constructor. If its signature changes, the code here will be broken. We perfectly know this scenario: *"I fixed it here, but now it is broken there"*. To fix this issue, we can inject an already constructed instance of the `Delivery` class.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class DeliveryController 
{
    protected $delivery;

    public function __construct(Delivery $delivery)
    {
        $this->delivery = $delivery;
    }

    public function sendOrder($orderId)
    {
        $order = Order::find($orderId);

        $this->delivery->sendOrder($order);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In other cases when you need to create a new object and pass some dependencies for it, factories can be a good solution. Simply inject a factory, that already has all the required dependencies. And then use it to build an object. Next time, when the process of instantiation changes, you should change only one line of code in the factory, instead of using *find in project* in your IDE.

## Maybe Your Don't Need It

Always think first before making any serious design decisions. Don't follow any rules blindly. When all these *gurus* on Twitter post articles about DI and discuss it's advantages, but you have some hardcoded dependencies in your code, that doesn't automatically mean that you are not a professional developer. As any other technique, it has pros and cons. Previously we have discussed dependency injection only in a positive light. However, you can add all these layers of indirection for dependency injection to solve the problem that doesn't really exist. If your class uses a dependency, but that concrete implementation is the only one available in your system, then it will be more painful to create a loosely coupled solution, rather than just use *new* keyword and forget about it.

Maybe you have `Api` class and it uses Guzzle client to send HTTP requests. It is very simle, it only knows the API endpoints and how to create requests. 

{% highlight php %}
<?php

namespace App\Api;

use GuzzleHttp\Client;

class Api 
{
    protected $client;

    public function __construct()    
    {
        $this->client = new Client();
    }

    public function getStatus($orderId)
    {
        $response = $this->client->get('https://example-api/status/' . $orderId);

        return $this->parseResponse($response);
    }

    protected function parseResponse($response)
    {
        return json_decode($response, true);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We can test `Client` class, but there is no solid reason to test `Api` class, since it is only a wrapper over the `Client`. Tests for `Api` class in reality will only check the code for typos: *expect this, and return that ... expect this, and return that*. So, we can simply hardcode the client in the constructor and use it.  

But let's see what happens if we follow *good practices* and use dependency injection in this case. At first, we need an interface `HttpClient`. Then we need to wrap a Guzzle client instance into a wrapper (adapter pattern), which implements this interface. Then we need a factory or dependency container, which will create this wrapper for us. And at least we can pass it to the constructor of `Api` class. 


{% highlight php %}
<?php

interface HttpClient {
    // ...
}

class GuzzleAdapter implements HttpClient{
    // ...
}

class Api 
{
    protected $client;

    public function __construct(HttpClient $client)    
    {
        $this->client = $client;
    }

    // ... 
}
{% endhighlight %}

And now ask yourself one question: *what is the probability that you will use another HTTP client implementation, instead of the Guzzle client?* In six months you will change it to Curl? I don't think so. Is it worth it? You have created all these classes and complexity to replace only one line of code, which is unlikely to be changed.
