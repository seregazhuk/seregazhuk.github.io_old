title: "The Difference Between Authorization and Authentication"

For me, words *authorization* and *authentication* have been synonyms. When I thought about *authorization* I have used *authentication* and
vice versa. 
So what is the key difference between these two words?

### Authentication
Is a process of identifying yourself. It answers the question **"who you are?"**

### Authorization
Is a process of checking if you are allowed to do, what you are going to do. It answers the question **"what can you do?**".
