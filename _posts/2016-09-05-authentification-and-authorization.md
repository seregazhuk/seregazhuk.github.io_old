For me words *authorization* and *authentication* have been synonyms. When I ment *authorization* I have used *authentification* and
vice versa. 
So what is the key difference between theese two words?

### Authentication
Is a process of identifying yourself. It unswers on the question **"who you are?"**

### Authorization
Is a process of checking if you are allowed to do, what you are going to do. It answers on the question **"what can you do?**".
