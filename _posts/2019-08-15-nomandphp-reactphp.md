Today [I've been talking about asynchronous PHP and ReactPHP at NomadPHP](https://nomadphp.com/live/2Ynpdgg6O4YKkZsTzA5hyW/Introduction-to-Asynchronous-PHP-and-ReactPHP/). Very interesting experience talking live on-line about the topic I love. I was a bit nervous about Q&A session, because English is not my native language. But everything was great!
