## What is Web Scraping?

Have you ever needed to grab some data from a site that doesn't provide a public API? To solve this problem we can use web scraping and pull the required information out from the HTML. Of course, we can manually extract the required data from a website, but this process can become very tedious. So, it will be more efficient to automate it via the scraper.

Well, in this tutorial we are going to scrap cats images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/){:target="_blank"}. This website provides high quality and completely free stock photos. They have a public API but it has a limit of 200 requests per hour.

## Making concurrent requests

The main advantage of using asynchronous PHP in web scraping is that we can make a lot of work in less time. Instead of querying each web page one by one and waiting for responses we can request as many pages as we want at once. Thus we can start processing the results as soon as they arrive. 

Let's start with pulling an asynchronous HTTP client called [buzz-react](https://github.com/clue/php-buzz-react){:target="_blank"} â€“ a simple, async HTTP client for concurrently processing any number of HTTP requests, built on top of ReactPHP:

{% highlight bash %}
composer require clue/buzz-react
{% endhighlight %}

Now, we are ready and let's request an [image page on pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/kitten-cat-rush-lucky-cat-45170/){:target="_blank"}:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;

$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

$client = new Browser($loop);
$client->get('https://www.pexels.com/photo/kitten-cat-rush-lucky-cat-45170/')
    ->then(function(\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response) {
        echo $response->getBody();
    });

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

We have created an instance of `Clue\React\Buzz\Browser`, then we have used it as HTTP client. The code above makes an asynchronous `GET` request to a web page with an image of kittens. Method `$client->get($url)` returns a [promise]({% post_url 2017-06-16-phpreact-promises %}){:target="_blank"} that resolves with a PSR-7 response object.

The client works asynchronously, that means that we can easily request several pages and these requests will be performed concurrently:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;

$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

$client = new Browser($loop);
$client->get('https://www.pexels.com/photo/kitten-cat-rush-lucky-cat-45170/')
    ->then(function(\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response) {
        echo $response->getBody();
    });

$client->get('https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-baby-blur-177809/')
    ->then(function(\Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response) {
        echo $response->getBody();
    });

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

The idea is here the following:

- make a request
- get a promise
- add a handler to a promise
- once promise is resolved process the response

So, this logic can be extracted to a class, thus we can easily request many URLs and add the same response handler for them. Let's create a wrapper over the `Browser`. 

Create a class called `Scraper` with the following content:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

final class Scraper
{
    private $client;

    public function __construct(Browser $client)
    {
        $this->client = $client;
    }

    public function scrape(array $urls)
    {
        foreach ($urls as $url) {
            $this->client->get($url)->then(
                function (ResponseInterface $response) {
                    $this->processResponse((string) $response->getBody());
                });
        }
    }

    private function processResponse(string $html)
    {
        // ...
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We inject `Browser` as a constructor dependency and provide one public method `scrape(array $urls)`. Then for each specified URL we make a `GET` request. Once the response is done we call a private method `processResponse(string $html)` with the body of the response. This method will be responsible for traversing HTML code and downloading images. The next step is to inspect the received HTML code and extract images from it.

## Crawling the website

At this moment we are getting only HTML code of the requested page. Now we need to extract the image URL. For this, we need to examine the structure of the received HTML code. Go to an [image page on Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-blur-cat-617278/){:target="_blank"}, right click on the image and select *Inspect Element*, you will see something like this:

<p class="text-center image">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/fast-webscraping-reactphp-images/pexels-inspect-element.png">
</p>

We can see that `img` tag has class `image-section__image`. We are going to use this information to extract this tag out of the received HTML. The URL of the image is stored in the `src` attribute:

<p class="text-center image">
    <img src="/assets/images/posts/fast-webscraping-reactphp-images/pexels-image-html.png">
</p>

For extracting HTML tags we are going to use [Symfony DomCrawler Component](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dom_crawler.html){:target="_blank"}. Pull the required packages:

{% highlight bash %}
composer require symfony/dom-crawler
composer require symfony/css-selector
{% endhighlight %}

[CSS-selector for DomCrawler](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/css_selector.html){:target="_blank"} allows us to use jQuery-like selectors to traverse the DOM. Once everything is installed open our `Scraper` class and let's write some code in `processResponse(string $html)` method. First of all, we need to create an instance of the `Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler` class, its constructor accepts a string that contains HTML code for traversing:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

final class Scraper
{
    // ...

    private function processResponse(string $html)
    {
        $crawler = new Crawler($html);
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

To find any element by its jQuery-like selector use `filter()` method. Then method `attr($attribute)` allows to extract an attribute of the filtered element:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

final class Scraper
{
    // ...

    private function processResponse(string $html)
    {
        $crawler = new Crawler($html);
        $imageUrl = $crawler->filter('.image-section__image')->attr('src');
        echo $imageUrl . PHP_EOL;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's just print the extracted image URL and check that our scraper works as expected:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// index.php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
require __DIR__ . '/Scraper.php';

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;

$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

$scraper = new Scraper(new Browser($loop));
$scraper->scrape([
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-blur-cat-617278/'
]);

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

When running this script it will output the full URL to the required image. Then we can use this URL to download the image. Again we use an instance of the `Browser` and make a `GET` request:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

final class Scraper
{
    // ...

    private function processResponse(string $html)
    {
        $crawler = new Crawler($html);
        imageUrl = $crawler->filter('.image-section__image')->attr('src');
        $this->client->get($imageUrl)->then(
            function(ResponseInterface $response) {
                // store an image on disk
        });
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

The response arrives with the contents of the requested image. Now we need to save it on disk. But take your time and don't use `file_put_contents()`. All native PHP functions that work with a file system are blocking. It means that once you call `file_put_contents()` our application stops behaving asynchronously. The flow control is being blocked until the file is saved. ReactPHP has a dedicated package to solve this problem.

## Saving files asynchronously

To process files asynchronously in a non-blocking way we need a package called [reactphp/filesystem](https://github.com/reactphp/filesystem){:target="_blank"}. Go ahead and pull it:

{% highlight bash %}
composer require react/filesystem
{% endhighlight %}

To start working with the file system create an instance of `Filesystem` object and provide it as a dependency to our `Scraper`. Also, we need to provide a directory where to put all downloaded images:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// index.php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
require __DIR__ . '/Scraper.php';

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use React\Filesystem\Filesystem;

$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

$scraper = new ScraperForImages(
    new Browser($loop), Filesystem::create($loop), __DIR__ . '/images'
);

$scraper->scrape([
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-blur-cat-617278/'
]);

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

Here is an updated constructor of the `Scraper`:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use React\Filesystem\FilesystemInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

final class Scraper
{
    private $client;
    
    private $filesystem;

    private $directory;

    public function __construct(Browser $client, FilesystemInterface $filesystem, string $directory)
    {
        $this->client = $client;
        $this->filesystem = $filesystem;
        $this->$directory = $directory;
    }

    // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

Ok, now we are ready to save files on disk. First of all, we need to extract a filename from the URL. The scraped URLs to the images look like this:

>*https://images.pexels.com/photos/4602/jumping-cute-playing-animals.jpg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940*
>*https://images.pexels.com/photos/617278/pexels-photo-617278.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940*

And filenames for these URLs will be the following:

>*jumping-cute-playing-animals.jpg*<br>
>*pexels-photo-617278.jpeg*

Let's use a regular expression to extract filenames out of the URLs. To get a full path to a future file on disk we concatenate these names with a directory:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

preg_match('/photos\/\d+\/([\w-\.]+)\?/', $imageUrl, $matches); // $matches[1] contains a filename
$filePath = $this->directory . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . $matches[1];
{% endhighlight %}

Once we have a path to a file we can use it to create a *file* object:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$file = $this->filesystem->file($filePath);
{% endhighlight %}

This object represents a file we are going to work with. Then call method `putContents($contents)` and provide a response body as a string:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$file = $this->filesystem->file($filePath);
$file->putContents((string)$response->getBody());
{% endhighlight %}

That's it. All asynchronous low-level magic is hidden behind one simple method. Under the hood, it creates a stream in a writing mode, writes data to it and then closes the stream. Here is an updated version of method `Scraper::processResponse(string $html)`:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;
use React\Filesystem\FilesystemInterface;
use Symfony\Component\DomCrawler\Crawler;

final class Scraper
{
    // ...

    private function processResponse(string $html)
    {
        $crawler = new Crawler($html);
        $imageUrl = $crawler->filter('.image-section__image')->attr('src');
        preg_match('/photos\/\d+\/([\w-\.]+)\?/', $imageUrl, $matches);
        $filePath = $matches[1];

        $this->client->get($imageUrl)->then(
            function(ResponseInterface $response) use ($filePath) {
                $this->filesystem->file($filePath)->putContents((string)$response->getBody());
        });
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We pass a full path to a file inside the response handler. Then, we create a file and fill it with the response body. Actually, the whole scraper is less than 50 lines of code!

>**Note:** at first, create a directory where you want to store files. Method `putContents()` only creates a file, it doesn't create folders to a specified filename.

The scraper is done. Now, open your main script and pass a list of URLs to scrap:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// index.php

<?php

require __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';
require __DIR__ . '/ScraperForImages.php';

use Clue\React\Buzz\Browser;
use React\Filesystem\Filesystem;

$loop = \React\EventLoop\Factory::create();

$scraper = new ScraperForImages(
    new Browser($loop), Filesystem::create($loop), __DIR__ . '/images'
);

$scraper->scrape([
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-blur-cat-617278/',
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/kitten-cat-rush-lucky-cat-45170/',
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animal-baby-blur-177809/',
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-animals-cats-cute-236230/',
    'https://www.pexels.com/photo/relaxation-relax-cats-cat-96428/',
]);

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

The snippet above scraps five URLs and downloads appropriate images. And all of this is being done fast and asynchronously.

## Conclusion

In [the previous tutorial]({% post_url 2018-02-12-fast-webscraping-with-reactphp %}){:target="_blank"}, we have used ReactPHP to speed up the process of web scraping and to query web pages concurrently. But what if we also need to save files concurrently? In an asynchronous application we cannot use such native PHP function like `file_put_contents()`, because they block the flow, so there will be no speed increase in storing images on disk. To process files asynchronously in a non-blocking way in ReactPHP we need to use [reactphp/filesystem](https://github.com/reactphp/filesystem){:target="_blank"} package.

I have several more articles on web scraping with ReactPHP: check them if you want to [use proxy]({% post_url 2018-06-20-fast-webscraping-with-reactphp-proxy %}){:target="_blank"} or [limit the number of concurrent requests]({% post_url 2018-03-19-fast-webscraping-with-reactphp-limiting-requests %}){:target="_blank"}.
