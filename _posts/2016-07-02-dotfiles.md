Basically dotfiles contain the preferred settings of your applications. They can save you much time when you setup your 
computer from a fresh system, or when you want to sync your settings on multiple devices.

## OS X Preferences

My main OS is OS X. All my OS and its applications settings (Finder, Safari, Photos) are placed in my `.osx` 
[dotfile](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx). To sync a new fresh system with 
my preferences I just need to run `source .osx`.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is necessary when using OS X. It helps to install packages and tools easy way through the command line. 
For me it is the first thing that I install on a fresh OS X system.

**Homebrew** also can help to install apps with [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io). It will download and install them automatically.
All your dependencies for your OS X system can be defined in a single `Brefile`. It is like a `composer.json` file, but for your Mac:

{% highlight bash %}
# Brefile
brew 'macvim'
cask 'item2'
{% endhighlight %}

These lines are equivalent to the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install macvim
brew cask install iterm2
{% endhighlight %}

Here is my own [Brewfile](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile), where all my installed apps and tools are
listed. Now I have to run simple command `brew bundle` to install all my OS X dependencies on a fresh system.

## Terminal and Shell

Customizing your shell is as important as customizing your IDE. I prefer to use [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org). It is like Bash on 
steroids. And like we have frameworks for programming languages Zsh has it's own frameworks of plugins and settings, and I prefer
[OhMyZsh](http://ohmyzsh.sh). It has it's own growing up community, a lot of different plugins and themes. I have chosen 
[Agnoster](https://gist.github.com/agnoster/3712874) theme and combined it with
[Solarized Dark](https://github.com/altercation/solarized) color scheme for iTerm2.

Zsh configuration is located in [zsh](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh) folder of my dotfiles. The main file 
here is [zshrc](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/zshrc). Usually, your OhMyZSH settings and options are listed in the `~/.zshrc` configuration file. 

Installation of OhMyZSH requires only one command:

{% highlight bash %}
curl -L http://install.ohmyz.sh | sh
{% endhighlight %}

## Installation

1. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
2. Install OS X Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`
3. Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to 600
4. Clone repo to `~/.dotfiles`
5. Run `./install.sh`

`./install.sh` will install Homebrew. Homebrew will start installing all the dependencies from Brewfile. Composer and npm will be installed with their global packages. At the end,
the `osx` file will be sourced to set OS X settings.
