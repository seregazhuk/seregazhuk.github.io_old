Basically dotfiles contain the preferred settings of your applications. They can save you much time when you setup your 
computer from a fresh system, or when you want to sync your settings on multiple devices.

## OS X Preferences

My main OS is OS X. All my OS and its applications settings (Finder, Safari, Photos) are placed in my `.osx` 
[dotfile](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx). To sync a new fresh system with 
my preferences I just need to run `source .osx`.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is necessary when using OS X. It helps to install packages and tools easy way through the command line. 
For me it is the first thing that I install on a fresh OS X system.

**Homebrew** also can help to install apps with [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io). It will download and install them automatically.
All your dependencies for your OS X system can be defined in a single `Brefile`. It is like a `composer.json` file, but for your Mac:

{% highlight bash %}
# Brefile
brew 'macvim'
cask 'item2'
{% endhighlight %}

These lines are equivalent to the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install macvim
brew cask install iterm2
{% endhighlight %}

Here is my own [Brewfile](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/Brewfile), where all my installed apps and tools are
listed. No I have to sum simple command `brew bundle` to install all my OS X dependencies on a fresh system.

## Terminal and Shell
