Basically dotfiles contain the preferred settings of your applications. They can save you much time when you setup your 
computer from a fresh system, or when you want to sync your settings on multiple devices.

## OS X Preferences

My main OS is OS X. All my OS and its applications settings (Finder, Safari, Photos) are placed in my `.osx` 
[dotfile](https://github.com/seregazhuk/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx). To sync a new fresh system with 
my preferences I just need to run `source .osx`.

## Homebrew

Homebrew is necessary when using OS X. It helps to install packages and tools easy way through the command line. 
For me it is the first thing that I install on a fresh OS X system.

**Homebrew** also can help to install apps with [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io). It can install apps from App Store
