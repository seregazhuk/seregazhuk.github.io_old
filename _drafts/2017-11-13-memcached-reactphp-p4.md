In the [previous article]({% post_url 2017-11-03-memcached-reactphp-p3 %}), we have completely finished with the source code for async Memcached ReactPHP client. And now it's time to start testing it. The client has a promise-base interface:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new Factory($loop);

$factory
    ->createClient('localhost:11211')
    ->then(function (Client $client) {
        $client->set('example', 'Hello world')
            ->then(function() {
                // the value was set
            });

        $client->get('example')
            ->then(function ($data) {
                // handle data
            });
});

$loop->run();
{% endhighlight %}

And how should we test this code? Should we create an event loop and `run()` it in every test? Or we don't need it at all? Let's figure it out.

### Preparing

It is necessary to decide what we are going to test. For the consumer's point of view the client has promises, that can be resolved or rejected. And actually all client methods return promises. So, we need to test that in some conditions these promises are resolved and in others - are rejected. Also, we can additionally check resolved values and rejection reasons.
As an example, let's test that the client resolves a pending request promise with the response from the server. 

Under the hood the client uses a duplex stream and Memcached protocol parser, but we are going to test the client code in isolation, so these dependencies will be mocked. 

>*For mocking objects I'm going to use a very popular [Mockery](https://github.com/mockery/mockery) library. It has very clear and intuitive interface, but if you meet some difficulties check out it's [official documentation](http://docs.mockery.io/en/latest/).*

So, we start with an empty test class:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

namespace seregazhuk\React\Memcached\tests;

use Mockery;
use Mockery\MockInterface;
use React\Stream\DuplexStreamInterface;
use seregazhuk\React\Memcached\Client;
use seregazhuk\React\Memcached\Exception\Exception;
use seregazhuk\React\Memcached\Protocol\Parser;
use seregazhuk\React\Memcached\Protocol\Request\Factory as RequestFactory;
use seregazhuk\React\Memcached\Protocol\Response\Factory as ResponseFactory;

class StreamingClientTest extends TestCase
{
    // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

The first thing we need to do is to set up the client and its dependencies:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class StreamingClientTest extends TestCase
{
    /**
     * @var DuplexStreamInterface|MockInterface
     */
    protected $stream;

    /**
     * @var Client
     */
    protected $client;

    /**
     * @var Parser|MockInterface
     */
    protected $parser;

    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->stream = Mockery::mock(DuplexStreamInterface::class)->shouldReceive('on')->getMock();
        $this->parser = Mockery::mock(Parser::class)->makePartial();
        $this->client = new Client($this->stream, $this->parser);

        parent::setUp();
    }

    // ...
}
{% endhighlight %}

`setUp()` method creates mocks and instantiates an instance of the client. Here is the source code of the client constructor:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

class Client 
{
    /**
     * @param DuplexStreamInterface $stream
     * @param Parser $parser
     */
    public function __construct(DuplexStreamInterface $stream, Parser $parser)
    {
        $this->stream = $stream;
        $this->parser = $parser;

        $stream->on('data', function ($chunk) {
            $parsed = $this->parser->parseRawResponse($chunk);
            $this->resolveRequests($parsed);
        });

        $stream->on('close', function() {
            if(!$this->isEnding) {
                $this->emit('error', [new ConnectionClosedException()]);
                $this->close();
            }
        });
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, it immediately calls `on()` method on the stream to attach some event handlers to `data` and `close` events. That's why I've set an expectation for `on()` method on the stream mock: `shouldReceive('on')`. Before implementing tests we need to add one more thing - a trait:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\MockeryPHPUnitIntegration;

class StreamingClientTest extends TestCase
{
    use MockeryPHPUnitIntegration;

    // ...
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

This trait is necessary for PHPUnit to assert mocked expectations. By default PHPUnit doesn't count Mockery assertions and if there are no `$this->assert*` calls in the test class, PHPUnit will report: `This test did not perform any assertions`. So we should include this integration trait in the test class. When all these preparations are done we can move to writing tests.

## Promise was resolved

So, we start with a simple test. It will check that the client resolves a promise from the request with a response data from the server. For these purposes we will use `version()` method, because it is very simple and has no arguments. The scenario is the following:

1. We call `version()` method.
2. We set up expectation that Memcached parser returned response `12345`, which we consider as a server version.
3. We assert that the promise from `version()` method was resolved with the value of `12345`.

To set mock expectations we need to refresh in memory what happens under the hood, when we call `version()` method on the client. The `Client` class has no such method, and for all Memcached commands it actually uses magic `__call()` method:

{% highlight php %}
<?phph

class Client 
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @param string $name
     * @param array $args
     * @return Promise|PromiseInterface
     */
    public function __call($name, $args)
    {
        $request = new Request($name);

        if($this->isEnding) {
            $request->reject(new ConnectionClosedException());
        } else {
            try {
                $query = $this->parser->makeRequest($name, $args);
                $this->stream->write($query);
                $this->requests[] = $request;
            } catch (WrongCommandException $e) {
                $request->reject($e);
            }
        }

        return $request->getPromise();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

In our test we have mocked instances of `$this->parser` and `$this->stream`. So, we start our test with setting up expectations for these mocks:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

// ...

class ClientTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_resolves_a_promise_with_data_from_response()
    {
        $this->parser->shouldReceive('makeRequest')->once();
        $this->stream->shouldReceive('write')->once();
        $promise = $this->client->version();

       // ...
    }    
}
{% endhighlight %}

The code above can be described like this: 

>*When we call `version()` on the client, it should call `makeRequest()` method on the protocol parser and then the client should call `write()` method on the stream. Then we call `version()` method, which returns a promise.*

And here comes the main section of this article: *how to test a promise*. In this particular test we need to check that the promise resolves with the data from the server. We assume, that the server has returned a string `12345` as a server version. To pass server responses to the client we can use `resolveRequests()` method. It accepts an array of responses and use them to resolve pending requests:


{% highlight php %}
<?php

// ...

class ClientTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_resolves_a_promise_with_data_from_response()
    {
        $this->parser->shouldReceive('makeRequest')->once();
        $this->stream->shouldReceive('write')->once();
        $promise = $this->client->version();

        $this->client->resolveRequests(['12345']);
        // assert that promise resolves with `12345`
    }    
}
{% endhighlight %}

The last step is assertion. Tests run synchronously, so we need to *wait* for a promise to be resolved. Then we get the resolved value and assert it with an expectation. For *waiting* (or running promises in a synchronous way) there is a nice library [clue/php-block-react](https://github.com/clue/php-block-react) from [Christian LÃ¼ck](https://twitter.com/another_clue). This library can be used for running ReactPHP async components in a traditional synchronous way - exactly what we need. After installing this library we have an access to a set of functions from `Clue\React\Block` namespace. One of them is `await()`:

`await(PromiseInterface $promise, LoopInterface $loop, $timeout = null)`

It accepts a promise, an instance of the event loop, and a timeout to wait. When promise is resolved this function returns a resolved In our case we don't have an event loop, so let's create one. It will be used in many tests, so I'm going to instantiate it in `setUp()` method:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

use Mockery\Adapter\Phpunit\MockeryPHPUnitIntegration;
use React\EventLoop\Factory as LoopFactory;

class StreamingClientTest extends TestCase
{
    use MockeryPHPUnitIntegration;

    /**
     * @var LoopInterface
     */
    protected $loop;

    /**
     * @var DuplexStreamInterface|MockInterface
     */
    protected $stream;

    /**
     * @var Client
     */
    protected $client;

    /**
     * @var Parser|MockInterface
     */
    protected $parser;

    protected function setUp()
    {
        $this->loop = LoopFactory::create();

        $this->stream = Mockery::mock(DuplexStreamInterface::class)->shouldReceive('on')->getMock();
        $this->parser = Mockery::mock(Parser::class)->makePartial();
        $this->client = new Client($this->stream, $this->parser);

        parent::setUp();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, the whole looks like this:

{% highlight php %}
<?php

// ...

class ClientTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_resolves_a_promise_with_data_from_response()
    {
        $this->parser->shouldReceive('makeRequest')->once();
        $this->stream->shouldReceive('write')->once();
        $promise = $this->client->version();

        $this->client->resolveRequests(['12345']);
        $resolvedValue = Block\await($promise, $this->loop);
        $this->assertEquals('12345', $resolvedValue);
    }    
}
{% endhighlight %}
