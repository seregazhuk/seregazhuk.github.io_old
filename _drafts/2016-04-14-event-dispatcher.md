## Event Dispatcher
The idea of event dispatcher is to allow communication between different parts of application 
without coupling them. In this way application can be easily maintainded and extended,
and it does not have to know about the classes that do it.

Event dispatcher can be used when refactoring legacy code, creating new application, or adding
new functionality to existing code with minimal changes.

## Ways of extending behaviour

## Inheritance
The most common way. Simply extend a class and original behaviour can be overwritten.
